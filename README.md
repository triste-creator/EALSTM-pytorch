# EALSTM-pytorch
# Introduction
 This is a model by long-short-time-model.We propose a new method based on short and long term memory networks for the task of predicting national carbon emissions data in the People's Republic of China,in this model,  we make use of Empirical Mode Decomposition and SelfAttention. In the area of Carbon prediction, this is a new method and none using it. Not only our model is using of the Carbon prediction,but also accuracy close to 2.6%
